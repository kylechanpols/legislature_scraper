# A Python Program to Scrap Legislature Databases

This is the Github Repository for the a python program to scrap legislature databases that I wrote for a previous project of mine.

There are three files in this program:

-`getlinks.py` - A program to recover a list of download links
-`download.py` - A program to automatically download legislative proceedings with variable timeout settings
-`pdf_parse.py` - A program that parses PDF files and turns them into plain text files for further processing.
-`paragraph-parse-1.py`, `paragraph-parse-2.py`,`paragraph-parse-3.py` - three different examples of parsers to select speeches and match them with the Member of Parliament (MP) who gave the speech, their gender and their party affiliation.
-`dictionaries` - A folder containing lists of MPs and their demographic information.
